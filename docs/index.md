![MWSE Modding Tutorial by Amalie](assets/social-preview.png){ loading=lazy }

In this tutorial series, You will learn the basics of [MWSE-Lua](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/) modding and you don't need any previous programming experience to follow along. I will be guiding you every step of the way to make a mod called Craftable Bandage.

This mod will allow you to use your character's bushcrafting skill to craft bandages from OAAB_Data and the effect will vary depending on your character's survival skill. 

The mod requires [OAAB_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042), [Skill Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034), [The Crafting Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51009), and [Ashfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057). So install them if you haven't already.
