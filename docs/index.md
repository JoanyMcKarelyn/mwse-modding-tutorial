![MWSE Modding Tutorial by Amalie](assets/social-preview.png){ loading=lazy }

In this tutorial series, you will learn the basics of [MWSE-Lua](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/) modding. No prior programming experience is required to follow along. This guide will walk you through every step in creating a mod called *Craftable Bandage*.

This mod will allow you to use your character's *Bushcrafting* skill to craft bandages from OAAB_Data and the effect will vary depending on your character's Survival skill.

The mod requires [OAAB_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042), [Skills Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46034), [The Crafting Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51009), and [Ashfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49057). So install them if you haven't already.
