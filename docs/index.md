In this tutorial series, You will learn the basics of [MWSE-Lua](https://mwse.github.io/MWSE/) modding and you don't need any previous programming experience to follow along. I will be guiding you every step of the way to make a mod called Craftable Bandage.

This mod will allows you to use your character's bushcrafting skill to craft bandages from OAAB_Data and the effect varies depending on your character's Survival skill. 

The mod requires OAAB_Data, The Crafting Framework, Skill Module, and Ashfall. So install them if you haven't already.
