# Episode 4: Adding Gameplay Features, Dictionaries.

Welcome back to another episode of MWSE Modding Tutorial. So our mod is almost complete. We'll be adding some additional features for bandages so they differs from a normal restore health potion and restore health spells.

The first feature I want to add is to get rid of the magical visual effect when you use a bandage. 

Even though magic is integrated in almost every aspect of TES, it is always nice to have non-magical alternative. This mod serves as an alternative to potion crafting and spell casting. Abd I want it to be different from those. 

The second feature I want to add is that the duration of the healing effect varies depending on your character's survival skill. So if your skill is at level 20, it heals for 20 seconds; and if your skill is at 40, heals 40 seconds.

To do that, we register the `equip` event. 

## Dictionaries

Now let's talk about dictionaries. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key-value pairs. Let me show you an example. 

```lua
local isBandage = { [bandageId1] = true, [bandageId2] = true }
```

So, a dictionary is enclosed in curly braces. `[bandageId1] = true` is one key-value pair, separated by a comma, and `[bandageId2] = true` is another key-value pair. `bandageId1` is the key, and `true` is the value.

A dictionary is a common way to classify thing. Here, it means `bandageId1` aka `"AB_alc_Healbandage01"` `isBandage` is `true`. In other words, "AB_alc_Healbandage01" is bandage.
