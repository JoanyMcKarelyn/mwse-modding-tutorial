## Dictionaries

Now let's talk about dictionaries. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key-value pairs. Let me show you an example. 

```lua
local isBandage = { [bandageId1] = true, [bandageId2] = true }
```

So, a dictionary is enclosed in curly braces. `[bandageId1] = true` is one key-value pair, separated by a comma, and `[bandageId2] = true` is another key-value pair. `bandageId1` is the key, and `true` is the value.

A dictionary is a common way to classify thing. Here, it means `bandageId1` aka `"AB_alc_Healbandage01"` `isBandage` is `true`. In other words, "AB_alc_Healbandage01" is bandage.
